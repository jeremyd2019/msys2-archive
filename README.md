# msys2-archive

Goals:

* Continuously archive package/file databases
* Provide a HTTP interface exposing old states of the repos
* Provide a web interface which allows selecting a date and shows a ready to use `pacman.conf` snippet to use the old state
* Redirect to mirror.msys2.org for all package/signature downloads
